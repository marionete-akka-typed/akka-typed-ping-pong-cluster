PingPong is a simple program, written for illustrative purposes, where 2 players (actors) send messages back and forth between them. Constraints are:
* use typed actors;
* run in a cluster
* spawn actors from a class (not singletons);
* no supervisors (future exercise); and
* state represented in a case class.
